  Project: Resolutions of argus issues through online forms. <br>
  Description: Many students of class 5E are facing problems on Argus platform and it is difficult for them to communicate their problems.
        We, the Demon Yato Clan members created a project that will send an online form for students to fill and submit issues faced on Argus.
        On submition, we get an e-mail where we can make sure that the problem is known. 
        We will try our best to solve your issues.</h3> <br><br><br><br>
